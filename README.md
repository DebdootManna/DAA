# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) - Java Implementation

This repository contains my personal implementations of various Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) concepts in Java.

**Note:** This repository is a collection of individual Java files, each representing a specific algorithm or problem solution. There is no structured folder organization.

## Contents

This repository includes Java code for the following algorithms and concepts:

* **[Algorithm Name 1].java**: Brief description of the algorithm (e.g., "Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.").
* **[Algorithm Name 2].java**: Brief description of the algorithm (e.g., "Solution to the Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming.").
* **[Algorithm Name 3].java**: Brief description of the algorithm (e.g., "Implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a graph.").
* **[Algorithm Name 4].java**: Brief description of the algorithm (e.g., "Implementation of Quick Sort.").
* **[Algorithm Name 5].java**: Brief description of the algorithm (e.g., "Implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.").
* ... (Add all your algorithm files here, one by one) ...

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DebdootManna/DAA
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd DAA
    ```
3.  **Compile the Java File:**
    ```bash
    javac [Algorithm Name].java
    ```
4.  **Run the Compiled Java Class:**
    ```bash
    java [Algorithm Name]
    ```
    (Replace `[Algorithm Name]` with the actual name of the Java file without the `.java` extension.)
